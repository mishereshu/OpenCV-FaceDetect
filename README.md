REQUIRED:
-Python Path is correct one, to check use 'where python' in command prompt to check python installation, fix it to the default installation path and add the path during the python installation if you do not have it already 
- Install Visual Studio CODE IDE (the one that i have used)
- Install Visual Studio with the C++ Build Tools

PS: don't mind the test file it was just to test the basic functionality
